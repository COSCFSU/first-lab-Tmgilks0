/*
    This is the interface for Lab00 in COSC310.  Create a class that implements
        this interface in the same package and call it LnameFnameLab00.

    The purpose of this lab is primarily to get used to coding again, but it
        will also help us to begin using Github.  All of our code will
        be committed to Github Classroom, so please familiarize yourself with it.

    If you do not have a Github account, please create one using the link
        provided.  If you do have an account already, you will need to tie it
        to this classroom account.

    !! The general process of what you should be doing:
        Whenever you have a "working version" of your code, COMMIT it.  This
        saves a LOCAL copy (to your hard drive).  Every now and then you should
        then PUSH it to github.  This uploads all your change history.
        Your assignments should show a number of commits !!
        
    !! Don't forget to PUSH your completed code to github.  This is how
        I will grade it !!
